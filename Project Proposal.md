# Problem statement

Every year 1.35 million people die due to car accidents ! That is more deaths than the number of deaths that occur due to heart disease in the world! The most common reason why this happens is that drivers are drunk, distracted and do not have fast reaction times. These are things that can easily be mitigated and will save those 1.35 million lives per year! There is a similar story where Sebastian Thrun the former head of the Google Self-Driving car team was going with this friend in the car when he was 18 years old. Due to his friend’s mistake of being distracted for a fraction of a second, the cost of that mistake cost him his friend’s life. There are thousands of other stories where small mistakes led to the loss of lives on the road. We know that this is a big problem and we need an answer to this problem. You may ask what is the solution to the problem and the answer is— self-driving cars.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66681194/148642045-cbb6feb8-3a54-4ed8-96e1-d5ba5a3b6bef.png)

# Data Description

This dataset provides data images and labeled semantic segmentations captured via CARLA self-driving car simulator. The data was generated as part of the Lyft Udacity Challenge . This dataset can be used to train ML algorithms to identify semantic segmentation of cars, roads etc in an image.
